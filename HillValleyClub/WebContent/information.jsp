   1. <b>Yercaud</b> Hailed as the Jewel of the South, 
   Yercaud means "Lake Forest" and gets its name because of all the trees that surround the lake.
   It is situated at almost 5000 feet above sea level in Salem District of Tamil Nadu.<br>
   2. <b>Nandi Hills</b> Also referred to as Ananda Giri which means the Hill of Happiness, 
   Nandi is in the shape of a sleeping bull (Nandi) and hence the name. 60 kms away from Bangalore, 
   Karnataka, Nandi has a fort at the top of the hill built by Tipu Sultan and is a favourite picnic spot for nature enthusiasts.<br>
   3. <b>Coonoor</b> After Ooty, Coonoor is the second-highest hill station in the Nilgiri region. 
   It is famous because of its serene beauty but unlike Ooty, it's not a bustling mess. 
   If you have nothing to do, Coonoor is the perfect place to do it in.<br>
   4. <b>Devikulam</b> Located very close to Munnar in Kerala, Devikulam gets its name from a lake. 
   According to legend, Goddess Sita bathed in this lake. The lake is hence held sacred and is 
   believed to have curative powers. The tea plantations and waterfalls that surround the tiny hill station add to the scenic beauty.<br>
   5. <b>Ponmudi</b> It is located 60-odd kilometres away from Trivandrum, 
   Kerala and is part of the Western Ghats. It is one of the few hill stations that 
   are close the sea and the mist-covered mountains add to the mystic charm of the place. 
   The rare flowers, the exotic butterflies and the tiny rivulets make the place a treat for nature lovers.<br>
   6.<b>Kodaikanal</b> The literal meaning of this hill station located in the Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu
   is Gift of the Forest. Meadows, grasslands, waterfalls, valleys and forestsmake it a complete hill station of sorts. 
   The most well-known and well-populated of all the places mentioned on this list, Kodaikanal offers the amenities of 
   a city up there in the hills.<br>
